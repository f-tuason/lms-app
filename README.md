This web application is a simplified version of an actual Learning Management System.
It is used to create teaching courses, and for students to buy them.
It is a combination of what we have learned in the course up until this time.
This is both the frontend/backend code of the project.
This has 3 permission based users, (admin, teacher, other, student) Admin can add users/categories.
